## Acknowledgements
> This project would've been almost impossible to make without [Brent Aureli's](https://github.com/BrentAureli) tutorial

[Brent Aureli's Mario tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8MPxzkwBwo&list=PLZm85UZQLd2SXQzsF-a0-pPF6IWDDdrXt&index=1), although a slightly outdated tutorial at the time, helped in providing the idea for the base layout of the game. It also provided a decent amount of information on how libGDX works. Big thanks once again to Brent Aureli for providing this tutorial.
